# xmonad config
This is [Marco Lopes](https://github.com/mlopes/dotfiles/)'s xmonad and xmobar configuration.
This configuration is rooted in the [xmonad](http://xmonad.org/) configuration used by Vic Fryzel as it was circa 2013, and was heavily customised since then. Years of customisations have left litle in common with the original configuration.


## Introduction

If you are unfamiliar with xmonad, it is a tiling window manager that is
notoriously minimal, stable, beautiful, and featureful.  If you find yourself
spending a lot of time organizing or managing windows, you may consider trying
xmonad.

However, xmonad can be somewhat difficult to configure if you're new to
Haskell or even to xmonad itself.

This folder contains a completely working and very usable xmonad
configuration "out of the box". If you are just starting out with xmonad,
this will give you a configuration that I've been using personally use for
work every day. Thought has been put into the colors, key bindings, layouts,
and supplementary scripts to make life easier.

## Dependencies

* xmonad (currently being used in 0.13-5)
* xmonad-contrib (currently being used in 0.13-4)
* [xmobar](http://projects.haskell.org/xmobar/)(currently being used with 0.24.5 with compiled with alsa support)
* [rofi](https://davedavenport.github.io/rofi/)/
* [scrot](http://freecode.com/projects/scrot)(currently being used with
* [slock](http://tools.suckless.org/slock/)(currently being used with 1.4-2)
* cmus
* amixer
* urxvt
* fish shell
* tmux
* xrandr
* kbdlight
* xbacklight

### Dependencies used while starting X and xmonad

* xsetroot - Used to set the background to black and the mouse to a left pointer
* setxbmap - Used to set X's keyboard layout. Default is set to `gb`
* xmodmap - Used to remap Caps Lock to Ctrl and to set AltGr+a, e, i, n, and c to dead \`, dead ', dead ^, dead ~, and รง, respectively 
* xcompmgr - Used to enable composide mode, shadows and transparencies on xmonad windows
* feh - Used to set the wallpaper. Will use the file in `~/.xmonad/wallpaper.jpg`


## Starting xmonad when logging in from a specific tty (example uses tty1)

    # Add the following to your `~/.bash_profile` file
    ```
    if [ "$(tty)" = "/dev/tty1" ]; then
        exec startx
    fi
    ```
    # Add the following to your `~/.xinitrc` file
    ```
    exec xmonad
    ```

    If you're using the configurations from this repository, these steps have
    already been done for you.


## Keyboard shortcuts

The following keyboard shortcuts are set in this configuration. It uses the `Win Key` in a PC or the `Command Key` on a
Mac.

* Win+Shift+Return: Start an instance of the urxvt terminal running the fish shell, which will open on Workspace 1
* Win+Alt+Return: Start an instance of the urxvt terminal running fish on tmux, which will open on Workspace 3
* Win+Alt+Return: Start an instance of the urxvt terminal running cmus, which will open on Workspace 9
* Win+Ctrl+l: Lock screen
* Win+p: Run the rofi launcher.  Once it comes up, type the name of a program and press enter to launch it
* Win+Shift+p: Take screenshot in select mode. Click or click and drag to select
* Win+Ctrl+Shift+p: Take fullscreen screenshot. Supports multiple monitors
* Win+Shift+c: Close focused window
* Win+Space: Change workspace layout

* Win+Shift+k: Swap focused window with previous window
* Win+h: Shrink master window area
* Win+l: Expand master window area
* Win+t: Push floating window back into tiling
* Win+,: Increment number of windows in master window area
* Win+.: Decrement number of windows in master window area
* Win+q: Restart xmonad. This reloads xmonad configuration, does not logout
* Win+Shift+q: Quit xmonad and logout
* Win+[1-9]: Switch to workspace 1-9, depending on which number was pressed
* Win+Shift+[1-9]: Send focused window to workspace 1-9
* Win+d: Focus left-most/internal monitor (Xinerama screen 1)
* Win+e: Focus center-most/external monitor (Xinerama screen 2)
* Win+r: Focus right-most monitor (Xinerama screen 3)
* Win+Shift+d: Send focused window to workspace on left-most monitor
* Win+Shift+e: Send focused window to workspace on center-most monitor
* Win+Shift+r: Send focused window to workspace on right-most monitor
* Win+Alt+1: Switch to single screen mode
* Win+Alt+2: Switch to dual screen mode
* mute button: Mutes the sound
* volume down button: Decreses the volume by 10%
* volume up button: Unmutes the sound and increases the volume by 10%

* keyboard brightness up: Increases brightness of keyboard backlight 
* screen brightness down: Decreases brightness of the screen
* screen brightness up: Increases brightness of the screen


## Personalizing or modifying xmonad configuration

Once cloned, xmonad-config is laid out as follows.

All xmonad configuration is in ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs.  This includes
things like key bindings, colors, layouts, etc.  You may need to have some
basic understanding of [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell)
in order to modify this file, but most people have no problems.

Most of the xmobar configuration is in `~/.xmonad/xmobar.hs`. Whichever
configurations are not in this file, should be in `~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs`, this
currently includes workspace colours and names.

All scripts are in ~/.xmonad/bin/.
